# Introduction

Machine learning techniques have become increasingly popular and relevant to solve text and sentiment related problems in recent years. It has boosted performance on several tasks and significantly reduced the necessity for human efforts. For this project, we focused on text classification, especially sentiment analysis, on two datasets, *Amazon Review* and *Drug Review*. While the *Amazon Review* dataset is popular and was being used for many research paper and projects, we adapted four classic text sentiment classifiers
on the dataset to see if obtained the 

Since there are researches about sentiment analysis on Amazon Review dataset, we will first use the same methods on the same dataset, and then replicate the methods on datasets other than the Amazon Reviews dataset. By completing the project, we are trying to realize the following goals:

-   Build four text sentiment classifiers on Amazon Reviews dataset (\verb|BoW|, \verb|Word2Vec|, \verb|GloVe|, \verb|fastText|);

-   Re-apply the above four classifiers on different datasets;

-   Compare different classifiers on different datasets.
